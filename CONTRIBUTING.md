# How to contribute

Help is always appreciated! ðŸ‘‹

To get started, if this is your first time contributing to a GitHub project, please take a look at the [Forking Projects guide][1]. The basic steps are:

1. **Fork** the project to your own account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine, typically with a command like `git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-amazon-spapi.git`.
3. Make changes to code from your local environment, then **commit** and **push** those changes back to your fork on GitHub.
4. Finally, [open a pull request][2], using your forked repo (and, specifically, the branch you updated) as the source, and ours as the destination.

## Creating a good Pull Request (PR)

- Check the branches! Most code changes should be made to our `main` branch, from which we will cut releases as needed. We may create other branches for longer-running projects, and you may or may not want to contribute to those projects yourself. Measure twice, pull once!
- Take some time to describe the changes you have made in the top comment of your PR.
  - If your changes refer to an issue or another PR within the repo, be sure to reference that issue with `#` and the number of that issue (if your changes correct something mentioned in Issue 34, use `#34` in the body of the comment). You can also reference an issue from commit messages.
- The larger a PR is, the harder it is to review its changes. If possible, restrict the number of changes to one or two issues at a time.
  - If you want to tackle multiple issues, you can always make additional PRs. It is always easier to handle many small PRs than one large one.
